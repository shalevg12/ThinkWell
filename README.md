# Project Overview
ThinkWell is an interactive computer game developed in C# and Unity with the integration of Firebase Database. The primary objective of this project was to create the first interactive computer game designed specifically for children with autism. The game aims to help children with autism improve their cognitive abilities, social skills, and overall engagement with interactive technology.

# Motivation
Our motivation for creating ThinkWell was to make a positive impact on the lives of children with autism around the world. We wanted to provide an inclusive and enjoyable gaming experience that would not only introduce children to technology but also stimulate their cognitive growth and social interactions. By building this unique game, we hoped to open new avenues for children with autism to explore the world of games and computers.

# Game Design
The game design was carefully crafted to cater to the specific needs of children with autism. We faced the challenge of creating a game that is both interactive and structured, allowing players to progress through the game while maintaining their engagement. After careful consideration, we merged elements from popular games like Monopoly and Snakes and Ladders to create a map with a clear start and end line.

# Card Types
ThinkWell incorporates three card types that facilitate learning and skill development:

**"Look Well" Cards":** These cards present children with images, such as a kid hugging a dog, and prompt them to identify and describe what they see. A correct answer allows them to move one step forward, while an incorrect answer results in moving one step backward.

**"Do Well" Cards:** In this card type, children are encouraged to give compliments to other players (competitors). Successfully providing a compliment allows them to move one step forward, while an incorrect response results in moving one step backward.

**"Think Well" Cards:** These cards contain sentence completion exercises. For example, a sentence might be, "I forgot to organize my room, so my parents are..." with multiple-choice options. A correct answer enables them to move one step forward, while an incorrect answer results in moving one step backward.

# Future Plans

We are committed to continuously improving ThinkWell and making it an even more impactful resource for children with autism. As part of our future plans, we aim to conduct research and gather feedback from users and experts in the field of autism to enhance the game's effectiveness and user experience.
